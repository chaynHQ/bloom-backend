# Bloom

Bloom is a remote trauma support service from Chayn, a global charity supporting survivors of abuse across borders. Bloom is our flagship product; a free, web-based support service designed for anyone who has experienced or is currently experiencing domestic or sexual abuse. Through a combination of online video-based courses, anonymous interaction and 1:1 chat, Bloom aims to provide tailored information, guidance, everyday tools, and comforting words to cope with traumatic events.

## Get involved

Bloom is created by Chayn, global nonprofit, run by survivors and allies from around the world, creating resources to support the healing of survivors of gender-based violence. There are lots of ways to get involved, from joining our volunteer team to [donating](https://www.paypal.me/chaynhq) or supporting us on social media.

## Local development

### Prerequisites

- NodeJS v12.x
- Yarn v1.x
- Docker

### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Create `.env` file

Environment variables must be added to a local `.env` file. Create this file using `.env.example` for reference, and adding values for local development.

### Run locally (with Docker) - RECOMMENDED

The project is containerized and can be run solely in docker - both the PostgreSQL database and NestJS app.

First make sure the docker app is running (just open the app). Then run

```bash
docker-compose up
```

You should see this in the shell output:

```shell
Listening on localhost:35001, CTRL+C to stop
```

_Note: you can use an application like Postman to test the apis locally_

**Run the app**

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

You should see this in the shell output:

```shell
Listening on localhost:35001, CTRL+C to stop
```

### Database migrations

A migration in TypeORM is a single file with SQL queries to update a database schema as updates/additions are made. Read more about migrations [here](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/blob/master/docs/migrations.md).

Migrations are automatically run when the app is built docker (locally) or Heroku for staging and production apps.

**You'll need to generate and run a migration each time you add or update a database field or table.**

To generate a new migration

```bash
yarn migration:generate -- bloom_backend
```

To run (apply) migrations

```bash
yarn migration:run
```

To revert a migration

```bash
yarn migration:revert
```

**New environment variables must be added to Heroku before release.**

### Run unit tests

To run all unit tests

```bash
yarn test:unit
```

To have your unit tests running in the background as you change code:

```bash
yarn test:unit:watch
```

### Formatting and linting

To run linting

```bash
yarn lint
```

To lint and fix

```bash
yarn lint:fix
```

Formatting and linting is provided by ESLint and Prettier (see the relevant configs for details).

Workspace settings for VSCode are included for consistent linting and formatting.

### Seed Local Database

Before you start, make sure:

1. bloom-local-db container is running in Docker
2. you are logged into the Heroku via your terminal. Read more about the Heroku Cli [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli)
3. Replace <HEROKU_APP_NAME> with the correct Heroku app name in the `seed-local-db.sh file`
4. Run `chmod +x ./seed-local-db.sh` in your terminal to make the file executable

After the above has been confirmed, run

```bash
bash seed-local-db.sh
```

## Git flow and deployment

Create new branches from the `develop` base branch. There is no need to run the build command before pushing changes to GitHub, simply push and create a pull request for the new branch. GitHub Actions will run build and linting tasks automatically. Squash and merge feature/bug branches into `develop`.

When changes are ready to be deployed to staging, merge `develop` into `staging`. This will trigger an automatic deployment to the production app by Heroku.

When changes have been tested in staging, merge `staging` into `main`. This will trigger an automatic deployment to the production app by Heroku.

## Swagger

Swagger automatically reflects all of the endpoints in the app, showing their urls and example request and response objects.

To access Swagger simply run the project and visit http://localhost:35001/swagger

## Database models

![Database models](database_models.jpg 'Database models')

**User**
Stores basic profile data for a user and relationships.

**Partner**
Stores basic profile data for a partner and relationships.

**Partner Admin**
Stores relationship between a partner and a user, and the partner access records created by the partner admin.

**Partner Access**
Stores the features assigned for a user by a partner. When a partner access record is created by a partner admin user, it is initially unassigned but the unique code generated will be shared with the user. When the user registers using this code, the partner access will be assigned/related to the user, granting them access to extra features. See `assignPartnerAccess`. Currently there are "tiers" of access determined by the frontend, however if future partners want different features for their users, settings for their features/tiers should be added to the `Partner` model.

**Therapy Session**
Stores data related to therapy sessions booked via Simplybook, copying the session time and details about the therapist etc. The duplication of data here (vs leaving it in Simplybook) was made to allow therapy reporting to be included in Data Studio. This model also allows for displaying therapy session data on the frontend. Populated by Simplybook -> Zapier webhooks.

**Course**
Stores data related to courses in Storyblok, copying the story id's. The `Course` records allow us to relate users to courses (via `CourseUser`) and a `Course` to `Session` records, which is required e.g. to check if a user completed a course. The slug and name etc are also stored for convenience, e.g. to be used in reporting. Populated and updated by Storyblok webhooks when course stories are published.

**Session**
Stores data related to courses in Storyblok, copying the story id's. The `Session` records allow us to relate users to sessions (via `SessionUser`). The slug and name etc are also stored for convenience, e.g. to be used in reporting. Populated and updated by Storyblok webhooks when course stories are published.

**CourseUser**
Stores relationship between a `User` and `Course` records, once a user has started a course. A users progress (`completed`) for the course is updated (`true`) when all related `SessionUser` records are `completed` for the related `Course`.

**SessionUser**
Stores relationship between a `User` and `Session` records, once a user has started a session. A users session progress (`completed`) for the session is updated (true) when the `/complete` endpoint is called.

## Key concepts

### User types

There are several user types with different features enabled.

**Public user** - joins Bloom without a partner, with access to self guided and live courses.

**Partner user** - joins Bloom via a partner (and access code) with access to extra features and courses enabled by the partner(s).

**Partner admin user** - a partner team member who uses the app to complete Bloom admin tasks such as creating new partner access codes.

### Authentication

User authentication is handled by [Firebase Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth). Bearer tokens are sent in api request headers and verified in [auth.service.ts](src/auth/auth.service.ts). The user record is fetched using the retrieved user email of the token.

### Crisp profiles

Crisp is the messaging platform used to message the Chayn team in relation to bloom course content or other queries and support. For public users, this 1-1 chat feature is available on _live_ courses only. For partner users, This 1-1 chat feature is available to users with a `PartnerAccess` that has 1-1 chat enabled.

Users who have access to 1-1 chat also have a profile on Crisp that reflects data from our database regarding their partners, access and course progress. See [crisp-api.ts](src/api/crisp/crisp-api.ts)

### Reporting

Google Data Studio is an online tool for converting data into customizable informative reports and dashboards.

The reports are generated by writing custom sql queries that return actionable data to Data Studio. Filters are applied in Data Studio allowing
data to be segregated into different time periods based on the data createdAt date

## License

Bloom and all of Chayn's projects are open source.
The core tech stack included here is open source however some external integrations used in the project require subscriptions.
